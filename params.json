{"name":"Fastsnmpy","tagline":"Superfast snmpbulkwalk in python","body":"\t\t     \t\tfastsnmpy README\r\n\t\t\tPython classes that extend the \r\n\t\tFunctionality of 'netsnmp' Extension Module\r\n\r\n### Main Features\r\n\r\nFastsnmpy is a module that leverages python-extensions that come \r\nwith net-snmp and provide highly parallelized faster-methods to walk\r\noid-trees on devices.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it provides a method to bulkwalk mib-trees. BulkWalk \r\nmethods are missing from native python-bindings for net-snmp. By \r\ncreating a wrapper around the GetBulk method instead, and maintaining \r\nstate while traversing the oid-tree, fastsnmpy provides a clever \r\nsolution to bulkwalk oids much faster.\r\n\r\nIt provides the following methods as of Fastsnmpy-1.2.1\r\n\r\n- snmpwalk(): Native python-bindings distributed with\r\n  net-snmp, combined with fastsnmpy's ability to parallelize\r\n  snmpwalk operations. \r\n\r\n- snmpbulkwalk(): Ability to snmpbulkwalk devices, which makes \r\n  it several magnitudes faster than net-snmp's implementation of snmpwalk.\r\n\r\n  By leveraging the getbulk method, this module provides a quick \r\n  snmpbulkwalk utility.\r\n\r\n- PROCESS-POOLS: By passing in a 'workers=n' attribute to the above \r\n  methods, fastsnmpy can instantiate a process-pool to parallelize \r\n  the snmpwalk and snmpbulkwalk methods, resulting in several devices \r\n  being walked at the same time, \r\n  effectively using all cores on a multicore machine.\r\n\r\n- One-Line, and Two-Line scripts that enable you to discover/walk\r\n  all devices in a whole datacenter\r\n\r\n- Both Linux and Windows support\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quick example - Running in interactive mode\r\n<pre>\r\nPython 2.7.10 (default) \r\n\r\n>>> import netsnmp\r\n>>> from fastsnmpy import SnmpSession\r\n\r\n>>> hosts =['c7200-2','c7200-1','c2600-1','c2600-2']\r\n>>> oids = ['ifDescr', 'ifIndex', 'ifName', 'ifDescr']\r\n>>> newsession = SnmpSession ( targets = hosts, oidlist = oids, community='oznet' )\r\n\r\n>>> results = newsession.snmpbulkwalk(workers=15)\r\n>>> len(results)\r\n171031\r\n>>> \r\n</pre>\r\nNote: To use the module in scripts, please see the example.py \r\nincluded with the package.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\n(1) Walking 30 nodes for ifDescr using snmpwalk():\r\n\t\r\n\ttime ./fastsnmpy.py\r\n\treal    0m18.63s\r\n\tuser    0m1.07s\r\n\tsys     0m0.38s\r\n\r\n(2) Walking 30 nodes for ifDescr using snmpbulkwalk():\r\n\r\n\ttime ./fastsnmpy.py\r\n\treal    0m9.17s\r\n\tuser    0m0.48s\r\n\tsys     0m0.11s\r\n\r\n(3) Walking 30 nodes for ifDescr using snmpwalk(workers=10):\r\n\r\n\ttime ./fastsnmpy.py\r\n\treal    0m2.27s\r\n\tuser    0m2.87s\r\n\tsys     0m0.66s\r\n\r\n(4) Walking 30 nodes for ifDescr using snmpbulkwalk(workers=10):\r\n\r\n\ttime ./fastsnmpy.py\r\n\treal    0m0.90s\r\n\tuser    0m2.44s\r\n\tsys     0m0.40s\r\n\r\nAs you can see, fastsnmpy's bulkwalk mode is almost 20 times faster \r\nthan using python's native snmp bindings for walking\r\n\t\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\nfastsnmpy module makes use of net-snmp and python extensions for \r\nnet-snmp. To use these classes, all you need to do is install net-snmp\r\nalong with python bindings.\r\nPlease review the LICENSE agreements for both, that are available from \r\ntheir respective websites.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to install this.\r\n(1) You can just copy all the classes in the code and paste it into\r\nyour script. This provides a quick, but very dirty way of using fastsnmpy\r\n(2) Download the fastsnmpy distribution, and install it as follows. This\r\nis the neatest method to use fastsnmpy:\r\n\t- untar the download\r\n\t- navigate to the directory\r\n\t- run \"python setup.py install\"\r\nIf you get stuck at any point, refer to the online documentation.\r\nhttp://www.ajaydivakaran.com/fastsnmpy\r\n\r\n\r\n### Release:\r\nThe most recent release should be available from PyPy, or from the \r\nauthor's website at http://www.ajaydivakaran.com/fastsnmpy\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\nSee example.py included with this build. I plan to put up more examples\r\non the website. So you may want to check there as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments:\r\nThe net-snmp-coders and the authors of 'python netsnmp extension'\r\nThanks in advance to any who supply patches, suggestions and feedback.\r\n\r\n### License:\r\n\r\n          fastsnmpy classes for 'netsnmp extension module'\r\n                    Copyright (c) 2010-2016 Ajay Divakaran\r\n\r\n'fastsnmpy' is free to use .
